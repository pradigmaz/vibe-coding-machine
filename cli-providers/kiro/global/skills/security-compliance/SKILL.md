## Core Principles

### 1. Defense in Depth
Apply multiple layers of security controls so that if one fails, others provide protection. Never rely on a single security mechanism.

### 2. Zero Trust Architecture
Never trust, always verify. Assume breach and verify every access request regardless of location or network.

### 3. Least Privilege
Grant the minimum access necessary for users and systems to perform their functions. Regularly review and revoke unused permissions.

### 4. Security by Design
Integrate security requirements from the earliest stages of system design, not as an afterthought.

### 5. Continuous Monitoring
Implement ongoing monitoring and alerting to detect anomalies and security events in real-time.

### 6. Risk-Based Approach
Prioritize security efforts based on risk assessment, focusing resources on the most critical assets and likely threats.

### 7. Compliance as Foundation
Use compliance frameworks as a baseline, but go beyond minimum requirements to achieve actual security.

### 8. Incident Readiness
Prepare for security incidents through planning, testing, and regular tabletop exercises. Assume compromise will occur.

## Decision Frameworks

### 1. Risk Assessment Framework

**When to use**: Evaluating security risks and prioritizing mitigation efforts

**Process**:

```
1. Identify Assets
   - What systems, data, and services need protection?
   - What is the business value of each asset?
   - Who are the asset owners?

2. Identify Threats
   - What threat actors might target these assets? (nation-state, cybercriminals, insiders)
   - What are their motivations? (financial gain, espionage, disruption)
   - What are current threat trends?

3. Identify Vulnerabilities
   - What weaknesses exist in systems or processes?
   - What security controls are missing or ineffective?
   - What are known CVEs affecting your systems?

4. Calculate Risk
   Risk = Likelihood × Impact

   Likelihood scale (1-5):
   1 = Rare (< 5% chance in 1 year)
   2 = Unlikely (5-25%)
   3 = Possible (25-50%)
   4 = Likely (50-75%)
   5 = Almost Certain (> 75%)

   Impact scale (1-5):
   1 = Minimal (< $10K loss, no data breach)
   2 = Minor ($10K-$100K, limited data exposure)
   3 = Moderate ($100K-$1M, significant data breach)
   4 = Major ($1M-$10M, extensive data breach, regulatory fines)
   5 = Catastrophic (> $10M, business-threatening)

   Risk Score = Likelihood × Impact (max 25)

5. Prioritize Risks
   - Critical: Risk score 15-25 (immediate action)
   - High: Risk score 10-14 (action within 30 days)
   - Medium: Risk score 5-9 (action within 90 days)
   - Low: Risk score 1-4 (monitor and accept)

6. Determine Risk Response
   - Mitigate: Implement controls to reduce risk
   - Accept: Document acceptance if risk is within tolerance
   - Transfer: Use insurance or third-party services
   - Avoid: Eliminate the activity that creates risk
```

**Output**: Risk register with prioritized risks and mitigation plans

### 2. Security Control Selection

**When to use**: Choosing appropriate security controls for identified risks

**Framework**: Use NIST CSF categories or CIS Controls

```
NIST CSF Functions:
1. Identify (ID)
   - Asset Management
   - Risk Assessment
   - Governance

2. Protect (PR)
   - Access Control
   - Data Security
   - Protective Technology

3. Detect (DE)
   - Anomalies and Events
   - Security Monitoring
   - Detection Processes

4. Respond (RS)
   - Response Planning
   - Communications
   - Analysis and Mitigation

5. Recover (RC)
   - Recovery Planning
   - Improvements
   - Communications

Control Types:
- Preventive: Stop incidents before they occur (MFA, firewalls, encryption)
- Detective: Identify incidents when they occur (SIEM, IDS, log monitoring)
- Corrective: Fix issues after detection (patching, incident response)
- Deterrent: Discourage attackers (security policies, warnings)
- Compensating: Alternative controls when primary controls aren't feasible

Selection Criteria:
1. Does it address the identified risk?
2. Is it cost-effective? (Control cost < Risk value)
3. Is it technically feasible?
4. Does it meet compliance requirements?
5. Can we maintain and monitor it?
```

### 3. Compliance Framework Selection

**When to use**: Determining which compliance frameworks to implement

**Decision Tree**:

```
What type of organization are you?

├─ SaaS/Cloud Service Provider
│  ├─ Selling to enterprises? → SOC2 Type II (required)
│  ├─ International customers? → ISO27001 (strongly recommended)
│  ├─ Handling health data? → HIPAA + HITRUST
│  └─ Handling payment cards? → PCI-DSS

├─ Healthcare Provider/Payer
│  ├─ U.S.-based → HIPAA (required)
│  ├─ International → HIPAA + GDPR
│  └─ Plus: HITRUST for comprehensive framework

├─ Financial Services
│  ├─ U.S. banks → GLBA, SOX (if public)
│  ├─ Payment processing → PCI-DSS (required)
│  ├─ International → ISO27001, local regulations
│  └─ Plus: NIST CSF for framework

├─ E-commerce/Retail
│  ├─ Accept credit cards → PCI-DSS (required)
│  ├─ EU customers → GDPR (required)
│  ├─ California customers → CCPA
│  └─ B2B sales → SOC2 Type II

└─ General Enterprise
   ├─ Selling to enterprises → SOC2 Type II
   ├─ Want broad recognition → ISO27001
   ├─ Government contracts → FedRAMP, NIST 800-53
   └─ Industry-specific → Check sector regulations

Multi-Framework Strategy:
- Start with: SOC2 or ISO27001 (choose one as foundation)
- Add: Data privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA) as needed
- Layer on: Industry-specific requirements
```

### 4. Incident Severity Classification

**When to use**: Triaging and responding to security incidents

**Severity Levels**:

```
P0 - Critical (Immediate Response)
- Active breach with data exfiltration occurring
- Ransomware encryption in progress
- Complete system outage of critical services
- Unauthorized access to production databases
- Response: Engage CIRT immediately, executive notification, 24/7 effort

P1 - High (Response within 1 hour)
- Confirmed malware on critical systems
- Attempted unauthorized access to sensitive data
- DDoS attack affecting availability
- Significant vulnerability with active exploits
- Response: Engage CIRT, manager notification, work until contained

P2 - Medium (Response within 4 hours)
- Malware on non-critical systems
- Suspicious account activity
- Policy violations with security impact
- Vulnerability requiring patching
- Response: Security team investigation, business hours

P3 - Low (Response within 24 hours)
- Failed login attempts (below threshold)
- Minor policy violations
- Informational security events
- Response: Standard queue, document findings

Classification Factors:
1. Data confidentiality impact (PHI, PII, financial, IP)
2. System availability impact (revenue, operations)
3. Data integrity impact (corruption, unauthorized changes)
4. Number of affected systems/users
5. Regulatory reporting requirements
```

### 5. Vulnerability Prioritization

**When to use**: Prioritizing vulnerability remediation

**Framework**: Enhanced CVSS with business context

```
Base CVSS Score × Business Context Multiplier = Priority Score

CVSS Severity Ranges:
- Critical: 9.0-10.0
- High: 7.0-8.9
- Medium: 4.0-6.9
- Low: 0.1-3.9

Business Context Multipliers:
- Internet-facing production system: 2.0×
- Internal production system: 1.5×
- Systems with sensitive data: 1.5×
- Development/test environment: 0.5×
- Active exploit in the wild: 2.0×
- Compensating controls in place: 0.7×

Priority Levels:
- P0 (Critical): Score ≥ 14 → Patch within 24-48 hours
- P1 (High): Score 10-13.9 → Patch within 7 days
- P2 (Medium): Score 6-9.9 → Patch within 30 days
- P3 (Low): Score < 6 → Patch within 90 days or accept risk

Additional Considerations:
- Can the system be isolated/segmented?
- Are there effective detective controls?
- What is the patching complexity/risk?
- Is there a vendor patch available?
```

### 6. Third-Party Risk Assessment

**When to use**: Evaluating security risks of vendors and partners

**Assessment Framework**:

```
1. Categorize Vendor Risk Level

Low Risk (Minimal assessment):
- No access to systems or data
- Limited integration
- Non-critical service
→ Simple questionnaire

Medium Risk (Standard assessment):
- Limited system access
- Non-sensitive data access
- Important but not critical service
→ Security questionnaire + evidence review

High Risk (Comprehensive assessment):
- Production system access
- Sensitive data processing
- Critical service dependency
→ Full assessment + audit reports + pen test

Critical Risk (Extensive assessment):
- Full production access
- PHI/PII processing
- Business-critical dependency
→ On-site audit + continuous monitoring + SLA

2. Assessment Components

For Medium/High/Critical vendors:
□ Security questionnaire (SIG, CAIQ, or custom)
□ Compliance certifications (SOC2, ISO27001)
□ Insurance certificates (cyber liability)
□ Security policies and procedures
□ Incident response plan
□ Disaster recovery/business continuity plan
□ Data processing agreement (DPA)
□ Penetration test results (for high/critical)
□ Right to audit clause in contract

3. Ongoing Monitoring

- Annual reassessment
- Monitor for breaches/incidents
- Review security updates and patches
- Track compliance certification renewals
- Conduct periodic audits (for critical vendors)

4. Vendor Risk Score

Calculate score (0-100):
- Security maturity: 40 points
- Compliance certifications: 20 points
- Incident history: 15 points
- Financial stability: 15 points
- References and reputation: 10 points

Action based on score:
- 80-100: Approved
- 60-79: Approved with conditions
- 40-59: Requires remediation plan
- < 40: Do not engage
```

## Best Practices

### Security Architecture
1. **Defense in Depth** - применяй multiple layers of security controls
2. **Zero Trust** - never trust, always verify каждый access request
3. **Least Privilege** - grant minimum access necessary
4. **Security by Design** - integrate security from earliest stages
5. **Fail Securely** - ensure systems fail in secure state
6. **Separation of Duties** - no single person has complete control
7. **Network Segmentation** - isolate critical systems
8. **Encryption Everywhere** - encrypt data at rest and in transit
9. **Secure Defaults** - ship with secure default configurations
10. **Immutable Infrastructure** - use immutable deployments

### Access Control
11. **MFA Everywhere** - enforce multi-factor authentication
12. **Just-in-Time Access** - grant temporary elevated privileges
13. **Regular Access Reviews** - quarterly certification of access
14. **Disable Promptly** - remove access immediately on termination
15. **No Shared Accounts** - each user has unique credentials
16. **Strong Password Policy** - minimum 12 chars, complexity, rotation
17. **Privileged Access Management** - use PAM for admin access
18. **Service Account Governance** - track and rotate service accounts

### Security Operations

24. **Incident Response Plan** - document and test regularly
25. **Tabletop Exercises** - practice incident response quarterly
26. **Post-Incident Reviews** - learn from every incident

### Application Security
27. **Shift Left Security** - integrate security in CI/CD
28. **SAST + DAST + SCA** - use multiple scanning tools
29. **Secure Code Review** - review critical changes
30. **OWASP Top 10** - mitigate all OWASP vulnerabilities
31. **Input Validation** - validate and sanitize all inputs
32. **Output Encoding** - encode outputs to prevent XSS
33. **Parameterized Queries** - prevent SQL injection
34. **Security Headers** - use CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options
35. **API Security** - authentication, rate limiting, input validation
36. **Dependency Management** - keep dependencies updated

### Cloud Security
37. **CSPM** - continuous security posture management
38. **IaC Scanning** - scan Terraform/CloudFormation before deploy
39. **Container Security** - scan images, runtime protection
40. **Least Privilege IAM** - minimal permissions for roles
41. **Encryption by Default** - enable encryption for all services
42. **Network Policies** - restrict traffic between services

## Антипаттерны

### ❌ BAD: Single Layer of Defense

```yaml
# Только firewall, нет других controls
security:
  - firewall: enabled
  # Нет IDS/IPS, WAF, encryption, monitoring
```

**Проблемы**:
- Single point of failure
- Если firewall bypassed - полный доступ
- Нет detection внутри периметра

### ✅ GOOD: Defense in Depth

```yaml
security:
  network:
    - firewall: enabled
    - ids_ips: enabled
    - network_segmentation: true
  application:
    - waf: enabled
    - rate_limiting: true
    - input_validation: strict
  data:
    - encryption_at_rest: AES-256
    - encryption_in_transit: TLS-1.3
  monitoring:
    - siem: enabled
    - edr: enabled
    - log_aggregation: true
```

---

### ❌ BAD: Trust by Default

```python
# Доверяем всем requests внутри сети
def process_request(request):
    # Нет authentication/authorization
    return execute_query(request.query)
```

**Проблемы**:
- Lateral movement после breach
- Insider threats не detected
- Нет audit trail

### ✅ GOOD: Zero Trust

```python
def process_request(request):
    # Verify identity
    user = authenticate(request.token)
    if not user:
        raise Unauthorized()
    
    # Verify authorization
    if not authorize(user, request.resource, request.action):
        raise Forbidden()
    
    # Log access
    audit_log.record(user, request.resource, request.action)
    
    # Execute with least privilege
    return execute_query(request.query, user.permissions)
```

---

### ❌ BAD: Secrets in Code

```python
# Hardcoded credentials
DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://admin:P@ssw0rd123@db.example.com/prod"
API_KEY = "sk_live_abc123xyz789"

def connect():
    return psycopg2.connect(DATABASE_URL)
```

**Проблемы**:
- Secrets в git history
- Exposed в logs, errors
- Невозможно rotate без deploy

### ✅ GOOD: Secrets Management

```python
import boto3
from botocore.exceptions import ClientError

def get_secret(secret_name):
    client = boto3.client('secretsmanager')
    try:
        response = client.get_secret_value(SecretId=secret_name)
        return response['SecretString']
    except ClientError as e:
        raise e

# Use secrets from vault
DATABASE_URL = get_secret('prod/database/url')
API_KEY = get_secret('prod/api/key')

def connect():
    return psycopg2.connect(DATABASE_URL)
```

---

### ❌ BAD: No Input Validation

```python
# SQL injection vulnerability
def get_user(user_id):
    query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}"
    return db.execute(query)

# XSS vulnerability
def render_comment(comment):
    return f"<div>{comment}</div>"
```

**Проблемы**:
- SQL injection
- XSS attacks
- Command injection

### ✅ GOOD: Input Validation & Output Encoding

```python
from html import escape
import re

def get_user(user_id):
    # Parameterized query
    query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = %s"
    return db.execute(query, (user_id,))

def render_comment(comment):
    # Validate input
    if not re.match(r'^[\w\s.,!?-]{1,500}$', comment):
        raise ValueError("Invalid comment")
    
    # Encode output
    safe_comment = escape(comment)
    return f"<div>{safe_comment}</div>"
```

---

### ❌ BAD: Overprivileged Access

```json
{
  "Statement": [{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": "*",
    "Resource": "*"
  }]
}
```

**Проблемы**:
- Full admin access
- Blast radius огромный
- Compliance violation

### ✅ GOOD: Least Privilege

```json
{
  "Statement": [{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
      "s3:GetObject",
      "s3:PutObject"
    ],
    "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/uploads/*"
  }]
}
```

---

### ❌ BAD: No Logging/Monitoring

```python
def login(username, password):
    user = User.query.filter_by(username=username).first()
    if user and user.check_password(password):
        return create_session(user)
    return None  # Нет logging failed attempts
```

**Проблемы**:
- Brute force не detected
- Нет audit trail
- Incident response затруднён

### ✅ GOOD: Comprehensive Logging

```python
import logging
from datetime import datetime

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def login(username, password, ip_address):
    logger.info(f"Login attempt: user={username}, ip={ip_address}")
    
    user = User.query.filter_by(username=username).first()
    
    if user and user.check_password(password):
        logger.info(f"Login success: user={username}, ip={ip_address}")
        audit_log.record({
            'event': 'login_success',
            'user': username,
            'ip': ip_address,
            'timestamp': datetime.utcnow()
        })
        return create_session(user)
    
    logger.warning(f"Login failed: user={username}, ip={ip_address}")
    audit_log.record({
        'event': 'login_failed',
        'user': username,
        'ip': ip_address,
        'timestamp': datetime.utcnow()
    })
    
    # Check for brute force
    if check_brute_force(username, ip_address):
        logger.error(f"Brute force detected: user={username}, ip={ip_address}")
        alert_security_team(username, ip_address)
    
    return None
```

---

### ❌ BAD: Unencrypted Data

```python
# Storing sensitive data in plaintext
def save_credit_card(user_id, card_number):
    db.execute(
        "INSERT INTO payments (user_id, card_number) VALUES (%s, %s)",
        (user_id, card_number)
    )
```

**Проблемы**:
- PCI-DSS violation
- Data breach risk
- Regulatory fines

### ✅ GOOD: Encrypted Data

```python
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
import boto3

def get_encryption_key():
    kms = boto3.client('kms')
    response = kms.decrypt(
        CiphertextBlob=ENCRYPTED_KEY
    )
    return response['Plaintext']

def save_credit_card(user_id, card_number):
    # Tokenize instead of storing
    token = payment_gateway.tokenize(card_number)
    
    # Or encrypt if must store
    cipher = Fernet(get_encryption_key())
    encrypted = cipher.encrypt(card_number.encode())
    
    db.execute(
        "INSERT INTO payments (user_id, card_token) VALUES (%s, %s)",
        (user_id, token)
    )
```

---

### ❌ BAD: No Incident Response Plan

```text
# Когда происходит breach:
"Что делать?? Кого звать?? Где логи??"
```

**Проблемы**:
- Chaos during incident
- Delayed response
- Evidence destroyed

### ✅ GOOD: Documented Incident Response

```yaml
incident_response_plan:
  severity_p0_critical:
    detection:
      - SIEM alert triggers
      - Security team notified immediately
    
    containment:
      - Isolate affected systems
      - Block malicious IPs
      - Disable compromised accounts
      - Preserve evidence
    
    investigation:
      - Collect logs from SIEM
      - Analyze memory dumps
      - Review access logs
      - Determine scope
    
    eradication:
