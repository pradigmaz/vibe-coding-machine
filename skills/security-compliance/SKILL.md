## Core Principles

### 1. Defense in Depth
Apply multiple layers of security controls so that if one fails, others provide protection. Never rely on a single security mechanism.

### 2. Zero Trust Architecture
Never trust, always verify. Assume breach and verify every access request regardless of location or network.

### 3. Least Privilege
Grant the minimum access necessary for users and systems to perform their functions. Regularly review and revoke unused permissions.

### 4. Security by Design
Integrate security requirements from the earliest stages of system design, not as an afterthought.

### 5. Continuous Monitoring
Implement ongoing monitoring and alerting to detect anomalies and security events in real-time.

### 6. Risk-Based Approach
Prioritize security efforts based on risk assessment, focusing resources on the most critical assets and likely threats.

### 7. Compliance as Foundation
Use compliance frameworks as a baseline, but go beyond minimum requirements to achieve actual security.

### 8. Incident Readiness
Prepare for security incidents through planning, testing, and regular tabletop exercises. Assume compromise will occur.

## Decision Frameworks

### 1. Risk Assessment Framework

**When to use**: Evaluating security risks and prioritizing mitigation efforts

**Process**:

```
1. Identify Assets
   - What systems, data, and services need protection?
   - What is the business value of each asset?
   - Who are the asset owners?

2. Identify Threats
   - What threat actors might target these assets? (nation-state, cybercriminals, insiders)
   - What are their motivations? (financial gain, espionage, disruption)
   - What are current threat trends?

3. Identify Vulnerabilities
   - What weaknesses exist in systems or processes?
   - What security controls are missing or ineffective?
   - What are known CVEs affecting your systems?

4. Calculate Risk
   Risk = Likelihood √ó Impact

   Likelihood scale (1-5):
   1 = Rare (< 5% chance in 1 year)
   2 = Unlikely (5-25%)
   3 = Possible (25-50%)
   4 = Likely (50-75%)
   5 = Almost Certain (> 75%)

   Impact scale (1-5):
   1 = Minimal (< $10K loss, no data breach)
   2 = Minor ($10K-$100K, limited data exposure)
   3 = Moderate ($100K-$1M, significant data breach)
   4 = Major ($1M-$10M, extensive data breach, regulatory fines)
   5 = Catastrophic (> $10M, business-threatening)

   Risk Score = Likelihood √ó Impact (max 25)

5. Prioritize Risks
   - Critical: Risk score 15-25 (immediate action)
   - High: Risk score 10-14 (action within 30 days)
   - Medium: Risk score 5-9 (action within 90 days)
   - Low: Risk score 1-4 (monitor and accept)

6. Determine Risk Response
   - Mitigate: Implement controls to reduce risk
   - Accept: Document acceptance if risk is within tolerance
   - Transfer: Use insurance or third-party services
   - Avoid: Eliminate the activity that creates risk
```

**Output**: Risk register with prioritized risks and mitigation plans

### 2. Security Control Selection

**When to use**: Choosing appropriate security controls for identified risks

**Framework**: Use NIST CSF categories or CIS Controls

```
NIST CSF Functions:
1. Identify (ID)
   - Asset Management
   - Risk Assessment
   - Governance

2. Protect (PR)
   - Access Control
   - Data Security
   - Protective Technology

3. Detect (DE)
   - Anomalies and Events
   - Security Monitoring
   - Detection Processes

4. Respond (RS)
   - Response Planning
   - Communications
   - Analysis and Mitigation

5. Recover (RC)
   - Recovery Planning
   - Improvements
   - Communications

Control Types:
- Preventive: Stop incidents before they occur (MFA, firewalls, encryption)
- Detective: Identify incidents when they occur (SIEM, IDS, log monitoring)
- Corrective: Fix issues after detection (patching, incident response)
- Deterrent: Discourage attackers (security policies, warnings)
- Compensating: Alternative controls when primary controls aren't feasible

Selection Criteria:
1. Does it address the identified risk?
2. Is it cost-effective? (Control cost < Risk value)
3. Is it technically feasible?
4. Does it meet compliance requirements?
5. Can we maintain and monitor it?
```

### 3. Compliance Framework Selection

**When to use**: Determining which compliance frameworks to implement

**Decision Tree**:

```

```

### 4. Incident Severity Classification

**When to use**: Triaging and responding to security incidents

**Severity Levels**:

```
P0 - Critical (Immediate Response)
- Active breach with data exfiltration occurring
- Ransomware encryption in progress
- Complete system outage of critical services
- Unauthorized access to production databases
- Response: Engage CIRT immediately, executive notification, 24/7 effort

P1 - High (Response within 1 hour)

- Medium: 4.0-6.9
- Low: 0.1-3.9

Business Context Multipliers:
- Internet-facing production system: 2.0√ó
- Internal production system: 1.5√ó
- Systems with sensitive data: 1.5√ó
- Development/test environment: 0.5√ó
- Active exploit in the wild: 2.0√ó
- Compensating controls in place: 0.7√ó

Priority Levels:
- P0 (Critical): Score ‚â• 14 ‚Üí Patch within 24-48 hours
- P1 (High): Score 10-13.9 ‚Üí Patch within 7 days
- P2 (Medium): Score 6-9.9 ‚Üí Patch within 30 days
- P3 (Low): Score < 6 ‚Üí Patch within 90 days or accept risk

Additional Considerations:
- Can the system be isolated/segmented?
- Are there effective detective controls?
- What is the patching complexity/risk?
- Is there a vendor patch available?
```

### 6. Third-Party Risk Assessment

**When to use**: Evaluating security risks of vendors and partners

**Assessment Framework**:

```
1. Categorize Vendor Risk Level

Low Risk (Minimal assessment):
- No access to systems or data
- Limited integration

‚Üí Simple questionnaire

Medium Risk (Standard assessment):
- Limited system access
- Non-sensitive data access
- Important but not critical service
‚Üí Security questionnaire + evidence review

High Risk (Comprehensive assessment):
- Production system access
- Sensitive data processing
- Critical service dependency
‚Üí Full assessment + audit reports + pen test

Critical Risk (Extensive assessment):
- Full production access
- PHI/PII processing
- Business-critical dependency
‚Üí On-site audit + continuous monitoring + SLA

2. Assessment Components

For Medium/High/Critical vendors:
‚ñ° Security questionnaire (SIG, CAIQ, or custom)
‚ñ° Compliance certifications (SOC2, ISO27001)
‚ñ° Insurance certificates (cyber liability)
‚ñ° Security policies and procedures
‚ñ° Incident response plan
‚ñ° Disaster recovery/business continuity plan
‚ñ° Data processing agreement (DPA)
‚ñ° Penetration test results (for high/critical)

- Conduct periodic audits (for critical vendors)

4. Vendor Risk Score

Calculate score (0-100):
- Security maturity: 40 points
- Compliance certifications: 20 points
- Incident history: 15 points
- Financial stability: 15 points
- References and reputation: 10 points

Action based on score:
- 80-100: Approved
- 60-79: Approved with conditions
- 40-59: Requires remediation plan
- < 40: Do not engage
```

## Best Practices

### Security Architecture
1. **Defense in Depth** - –ø—Ä–∏–º–µ–Ω—è–π multiple layers of security controls
2. **Zero Trust** - never trust, always verify –∫–∞–∂–¥—ã–π access request
3. **Least Privilege** - grant minimum access necessary
4. **Security by Design** - integrate security from earliest stages
5. **Fail Securely** - ensure systems fail in secure state
6. **Separation of Duties** - no single person has complete control
7. **Network Segmentation** - isolate critical systems
8. **Encryption Everywhere** - encrypt data at rest and in transit
9. **Secure Defaults** - ship with secure default configurations
10. **Immutable Infrastructure** - use immutable deployments

### Access Control
11. **MFA Everywhere** - enforce multi-factor authentication
12. **Just-in-Time Access** - grant temporary elevated privileges
13. **Regular Access Reviews** - quarterly certification of access
14. **Disable Promptly** - remove access immediately on termination
15. **No Shared Accounts** - each user has unique credentials
16. **Strong Password Policy** - minimum 12 chars, complexity, rotation
17. **Privileged Access Management** - use PAM for admin access
18. **Service Account Governance** - track and rotate service accounts

### Security Operations

24. **Incident Response Plan** - document and test regularly
25. **Tabletop Exercises** - practice incident response quarterly
26. **Post-Incident Reviews** - learn from every incident

### Application Security
27. **Shift Left Security** - integrate security in CI/CD
28. **SAST + DAST + SCA** - use multiple scanning tools
29. **Secure Code Review** - review critical changes
30. **OWASP Top 10** - mitigate all OWASP vulnerabilities
31. **Input Validation** - validate and sanitize all inputs
32. **Output Encoding** - encode outputs to prevent XSS
33. **Parameterized Queries** - prevent SQL injection
34. **Security Headers** - use CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options
35. **API Security** - authentication, rate limiting, input validation
36. **Dependency Management** - keep dependencies updated

### Cloud Security
37. **CSPM** - continuous security posture management
38. **IaC Scanning** - scan Terraform/CloudFormation before deploy
39. **Container Security** - scan images, runtime protection
40. **Least Privilege IAM** - minimal permissions for roles
41. **Encryption by Default** - enable encryption for all services
42. **Network Policies** - restrict traffic between services
43. **Audit Logging** - enable CloudTrail/Activity Log
44. **Resource Tagging** - tag resources for governance

### Compliance
45. **Continuous Compliance** - not one-time, ongoing process
46. **Automate Evidence** - collect evidence automatically
47. **Control Mapping** - map controls to multiple frameworks
48. **Document Everything** - if not documented, doesn't exist
49. **Internal Audits** - conduct before external audits
50. **Compliance Calendar** - track all deadlines

### ‚ùå BAD: No Logging/Monitoring

```python
def login(username, password):
    user = User.query.filter_by(username=username).first()
    if user and user.check_password(password):
        return create_session(user)
    return None  # –ù–µ—Ç logging failed attempts
```

**–ü—Ä–æ–±–ª–µ–º—ã**:
- Brute force –Ω–µ detected
- –ù–µ—Ç audit trail
- Incident response –∑–∞—Ç—Ä—É–¥–Ω—ë–Ω

### ‚úÖ GOOD: Comprehensive Logging

```python
import logging
from datetime import datetime

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def login(username, password, ip_address):
    logger.info(f"Login attempt: user={username}, ip={ip_address}")
    
    user = User.query.filter_by(username=username).first()
    
    if user and user.check_password(password):
        logger.info(f"Login success: user={username}, ip={ip_address}")
        audit_log.record({
            'event': 'login_success',
            'user': username,
            'ip': ip_address,
            'timestamp': datetime.utcnow()
        })
        return create_session(user)
    
    logger.warning(f"Login failed: user={username}, ip={ip_address}")
    audit_log.record({
        'event': 'login_failed',
        'user': username,
        'ip': ip_address,
        'timestamp': datetime.utcnow()
    })
    
    # Check for brute force
    if check_brute_force(username, ip_address):
        logger.error(f"Brute force detected: user={username}, ip={ip_address}")
        alert_security_team(username, ip_address)
    
    return None
```

### ‚ùå BAD: Unencrypted Data

```python
# Storing sensitive data in plaintext
def save_credit_card(user_id, card_number):
    db.execute(
        "INSERT INTO payments (user_id, card_number) VALUES (%s, %s)",
        (user_id, card_number)
    )
```

**–ü—Ä–æ–±–ª–µ–º—ã**:
- PCI-DSS violation
- Data breach risk
- Regulatory fines

### ‚úÖ GOOD: Encrypted Data

```python
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
import boto3

def get_encryption_key():
    kms = boto3.client('kms')
    response = kms.decrypt(
        CiphertextBlob=ENCRYPTED_KEY
    )
    return response['Plaintext']

def save_credit_card(user_id, card_number):
    # Tokenize instead of storing
    token = payment_gateway.tokenize(card_number)
    
    # Or encrypt if must store
    cipher = Fernet(get_encryption_key())
    encrypted = cipher.encrypt(card_number.encode())
    
    db.execute(
        "INSERT INTO payments (user_id, card_token) VALUES (%s, %s)",
        (user_id, token)
    )
```

---

### ‚ùå BAD: No Incident Response Plan

```text
# –ö–æ–≥–¥–∞ –ø—Ä–æ–∏—Å—Ö–æ–¥–∏—Ç breach:
"–ß—Ç–æ –¥–µ–ª–∞—Ç—å?? –ö–æ–≥–æ –∑–≤–∞—Ç—å?? –ì–¥–µ –ª–æ–≥–∏??"
```

**–ü—Ä–æ–±–ª–µ–º—ã**:
- Chaos during incident
- Delayed response
- Evidence destroyed

### ‚úÖ GOOD: Documented Incident Response

```yaml
incident_response_plan:
  severity_p0_critical:
    detection:
      - SIEM alert triggers
      - Security team notified immediately
    
    containment:
      - Isolate affected systems
      - Block malicious IPs
      - Disable compromised accounts
      - Preserve evidence
    
    investigation:
      - Collect logs from SIEM
      - Analyze memory dumps
      - Review access logs
      - Determine scope
    
    eradication:
      - Remove malware
      - Patch vulnerabilities
      - Reset credentials
    
    recovery:
      - Restore from backups
      - Verify system integrity
      - Return to production
    
    post_incident:
      - Root cause analysis
      - Update playbooks
      - Executive report
      - Regulatory notification (if required)
    
    contacts:
      - CISO: +1-xxx-xxx-xxxx
      - Security Team: security@example.com
      - Legal: legal@example.com
      - PR: pr@example.com
